    intro:

        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: Let’s start with the basics for our readers. Who are you outside the lecture hall? Tell us a bit about yourself.",
        answer:
          "Outside the lecture hall, I’m someone who values growth, learning, and meaningful connections. I enjoy reading and engaging in activities that help me develop intellectually and personally—just nothing that puts me in the spotlight because I’m very, very introverted.\n\nI’m also a naturally observant and quiet person unless I’m with my small circle. I’m always looking for ways to improve myself while contributing positively to others. And yes—I love writing. I’m currently working on my first non-fiction book with a friend.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: What first drew you into studying Pharmacy? Was it a long-time dream or something you discovered along the way?",
        answer:
          "Interestingly, studying Pharmacy wasn’t my original plan. I applied for Medicine and Surgery, but the school offered me Pharmacy instead—an interestingly complicated story for another day.\n\nAt first, it was unexpected, but with time, I grew to appreciate the depth, impact, and scientific beauty of the profession… well, with a little convincing from my mum—she can be very persuasive. Eventually I realised Pharmacy aligns perfectly with my strengths, my love for science, and my desire to contribute meaningfully to healthcare.\n\nToday, I’m grateful for how it turned out—kinda.",

        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: You were the only student to earn straight A’s and also won the Dr. Chukwumerije Prize. Is this kind of performance usual for you?",
        answer:
          "Thank you. Academic excellence has always been part of my journey. I’m used to working hard and performing well—I've usually had perfect streaks like this throughout my academic life.\n\nBut achieving a perfect straight-A streak at the university level is still special to me. It reflects growth, consistency, and the grace to maintain my standards even as the workload increased.\n\nI just hope I can keep it up.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: Looking back, what played the biggest role in helping you achieve such results?",
        answer:
          "Three things: discipline, consistency, and intentionality.\n\nI try not to postpone learning. Understanding and practicality matter a lot for someone like me who cannot cram. If I depend on cramming, exams will destroy me. So I prefer starting early and finding a reading method that works for me.\n\nI also follow a routine that keeps me focused. And above everything, I give credit to God’s grace—because the strength, clarity, and favour I enjoy definitely come from Him.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: Pharmacy school is intense. How do you cover so much without feeling overwhelmed?",
        answer:
          "It would be a lie to say I never feel overwhelmed—my friends can testify. I call them a lot during the holidays because the anxiety gets to me, especially during first semester when the exam timetable is close and we haven’t even resumed.\n\nBut a few things help: focusing on understanding, summarising in my own words, practising past questions, and breaking large topics into smaller pieces.\n\nI even once tore my Nigerian People and Culture textbook into pieces and stapled them chapter by chapter because the whole thing wasn’t sticking. No regrets.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: How do you balance academic demands with your personal life?",
        answer:
          "I create structure. I plan my tasks, set boundaries, and prioritise both work and rest—emphasis on rest so you don’t black out.\n\nI also make time for family, relaxation, and activities that recharge me. If you don’t understand what you're reading, drop the book and take a break.\n\nBalance doesn’t happen by accident—you have to plan it.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: Perfect grades come with pressure. What helps you stay calm and focused?",
        answer:
          "My mindset is simple: do your best and trust God with the rest.\n\nI avoid comparison, stay organised, and choose consistency over last-minute stress. Thankfully, I don’t think people know me well enough here to put pressure on me like in primary and secondary school—thank God.\n\nWhen things get intense, I take short breaks, pray, breathe, and reset. And please—fill your manuals early.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: Who supported you the most—lecturers, friends, or family?",
        answer:
          "All three played important roles.\n\nMy lecturers lectured—simple but vital.\n\nMy friends offered teamwork, encouragement, and discussions that strengthened my understanding.\n\nMy family kept me grounded emotionally, prayed for me, reminded me to rest, and most importantly—sent me money.\n\nMy parents are tired of the calls I make just to complain and say I’m dropping out. My dad even told me to come back and marry Odogwu.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: What advice would you give to students who want to improve academically without burning out?",
        answer:
          "Be consistent with small daily efforts. Review your notes early, break tasks into manageable parts, and don’t be afraid to ask for help.\n\nSurround yourself with people who motivate you. And take care of your body and mind—good grades should never cost you your peace.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "INTERVIEWER: As we enter a new semester, what is one academic habit every student should start immediately?",
        answer:
          "Review your lecture notes within 24 hours—yes, it’s a great habit. Do I personally do it? Not always.\n\nBut weekly revision is realistic.\n\nMore importantly? Read for all your CAs and attend every practical. Small habits, big results.",
