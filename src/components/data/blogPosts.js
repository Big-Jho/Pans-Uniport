            Why do you think there is no cure for HIV yet? Do you think some
            viruses are stronger than others? How much of HIV pathology is
            driven by the virus itself, and how much is driven by the host’s
            genetic predisposition to inflammation, immune exhaustion and drug
            metabolism?

          "The narrative of HIV pathology has always been of an aggressive virus attacking CD4+ cells, hijacking host cell machinery, destroying the immune system, and leaving the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections. However true this is, it is one sided and rather incomplete because the host's genetic makeup plays an equally significant role with respect to inflammation regulation, the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline, viral load control, susceptibility to infection, immune exhaustion and senescence. Just as the virulence and pathogenicity of a pathogen influence disease, the host's genetics can define susceptibility to HIV pathology, and two patients having the same viral load will respond very differently to antiretroviral therapy (ART).",

          "The first aspect of this variation is in the immunogenomic profile. HIV relies on evading immune recognition while the host relies on presenting viral fragments to cytotoxic T cells. This dance is governed largely by HLA class I genes which determine how effectively infected cells present viral fragments to cytotoxic T cells for clearance. People with certain HLA variants, like HLA-B*27 or HLA-B*57 will mount stronger and better cytotoxic response against the virus. Others with less protective alleles cannot help but allow the same virus to replicate more freely.",

          "An interesting case was reported in 2014 in the Journal of Translational Medicine, where a researcher described a woman (named CASE1) who has been infected with HIV over 20 years earlier, yet for at least 14 of those years she maintained an undetectable viral load without receiving ART. Her blood never showed a measurable viral count and her immune system remained stable. She never progressed to AIDS despite decades of this untreated infection, neither did she transmit HIV to her sexual partner or to her child. Our concern is not whether or not she was able to transmit the virus but what set CASE1 apart was her genetic profile. She carried certain variants of human leukocyte antigen (HLA), specifically HLA-B*57 (a specific HLA allele), and specific HLA-C single nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with delayed progression and viral control. Immunologically, her CD8+ T cells showed strong, targeted responses against viral proteins (Gag and Nef), enabling her immune system to suppress HIV despite the virus still being able to replicate as supposed, making her part of the rare group of Elite Controller Status individuals.

          "Drug processing paints another interesting picture because all patients will not respond to antiretroviral therapy the same way due to genomic differences. Variations on genes that code for  CYP2B6 which metabolizes efavirenz, will either increase or decrease drug plasma concentration. The CYP2B6*4 allele increases enzyme activity and speeds up efavirenz clearance, whereas CYP2B6*516G>T and 983T>C reduce CYP2B6 activity and raise efavirenz levels. Same goes for genes that code for other HIV drug enzymes and transport proteins. When drug is metabolized properly and treatment is tolerated, viral suppression is rapid but when the host's genetics becomes the hinderance, suppression slows down and resistance may emerge, not because the virus is more aggressive but because the ground beneath the battle shifts, leaving the fight uneven and the outcome altered.",
